## **Sample Dataset \#3: User Conversion and Engagement Funnel Analysis**

---

This dataset provides a snapshot of user actions taken during their journey on the platform, from initial landing page visit to potentially signing up and inviting friends. The table highlights key touchpoints, tracking whether a user has visited the landing page, submitted personal and billing information, agreed to the platform's terms, successfully signed up, and invited friends. By examining these behaviors, businesses can understand where potential bottlenecks or drop-offs occur, enabling them to optimize user experience and improve conversion rates.

### **Success Spectrum: Moving users to more valuable states in a sign-up flow / customer journey**

# **Ambiguity Assessment**

---

Different marketing teams working in silos within the same organization might face challenges in understanding KPIs in the same manner. For example, the digital marketing team could focus on customer acquisition through online channels and might view Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) solely in the context of digital advertising spend. On the other hand, the field marketing team could be engaged in events and face-to-face engagements, where the costs associated with customer acquisition might include event sponsorship, printed materials, and more.

This divergence could lead to different CAC calculations for both teams, even if they are targeting the same customer base. Without a centralized data reporting system or standardized definitions, teams can have a disconnected view of success metrics, making organization-wide decisions difficult and ineffective.

Different teams may have different approaches to calculating and interpreting the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).



The Digital Marketing Team might consider CAC as the cost spent on digital ads divided by the number of customers acquired through digital channels. Their formula might look like:

\begin{equation}
  \text{CAC}_{\text{Digital}} = \frac{\text{Total Digital Ad Spend}}{\text{Customers Acquired Through Digital Channels}}
\end{equation}



The Field Marketing Team might have a broader view, including costs like event sponsorships, printed materials, and so on. Their formula might be:

\begin{equation}
  \text{CAC}_{\text{Field}} = \frac{\text{Total Event Sponsorships} + \text{Cost of Printed Materials}}{\text{Customers Acquired Through Field Marketing}}
\end{equation}

The above two formulas show that CAC can be calculated in different ways, depending on the focus of the team. This could lead to discrepancies in reported figures, causing challenges in decision-making at an organizational level.

Example of how the data might look like with these different calculations and unresolved ambiguity:

## **Example of Discrepencies for a Single Marketing Term with 2 Teams: CAC**

<br>

| Month          | Field Marketing CAC (USD) | Digital Marketing CAC (USD) | Discrepancy (USD) |
|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| January 2023   | 50.32                     | 38.75                       | 11.57              |
| February 2023  | 55.23                     | 44.51                       | 10.72              |
| March 2023     | 53.67                     | 42.32                       | 11.35              |

<br>


## **Ambiguity in the Measures**

Measures define what you're capturing in your data. They articulate the variables that hold specific values. For example, "Cost" measures how much money was expended to acquire a user.

- **Minimum Success Criteria**: These are predetermined criteria to assess success. However, it's ambiguous when these should be achieved—daily, weekly, or over some other period.
  
- **Success Achieved?**: While this appears straightforward (Yes/No), it's unclear what should happen if the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) precisely meets the minimum success criteria.
  
- **Deviation (%)**: This indicates how far a measure has strayed from a benchmark. The ambiguity lies in not knowing if a higher or lower percentage is favorable and against what benchmark the deviation is calculated.

- **Revenue Generated from Ads in ROAS**: The ambiguity here is whether this refers to net or gross revenue.

- **Organic Traffic This Month / Last Month**: Specifying actual dates would clear up any confusion about what "this month" or "last month" refers to.

- **Social Media Engagement (Interactions)**: It's unclear what counts as an "interaction"—likes, shares, comments, or something else.



<br>


## Ambiguity in the Metrics

<br>



Metrics provide a quantifiable means to evaluate measures. For instance, cost can be quantified in terms of USD, EUR, etc.

- **Date Format**: Ambiguity can arise if the date format isn't consistent. Also, including the time zone could be crucial for clarity.

- **Currency**: Specifying the currency for all monetary metrics can remove ambiguity.

- **Units**: For metrics like Conversion Rate and Bounce Rate, stating whether the figures are rounded or truncated can add precision.

- **Time Frame**: Without a specified time frame (daily, monthly, yearly), metrics can become ambiguous.

- **Total Visitors in Conversion Rate**: Ambiguity arises when it's not clear if this includes repeat visitors, bot traffic, or other specific kinds of visits.



## Ambiguities about the Data Quality

Ambiguities in data quality can significantly affect the reliability of analyses.

- **Source of Data**: Knowing where the data originates—whether from internal analytics, an industry report, or aggregated from various sources—can add credibility.

- **Statistical Significance**: If percentages like Conversion Rate and Bounce Rate aren't statistically validated, their reliability becomes questionable.

- **Normalization**: If data comes from different channels, time periods, or customer segments, it's unclear if it has been normalized to enable a meaningful comparison.

## Ambiguity in Knowing What Problem to Solve (The Problem with Problems...)
By representing the user as moving from a start to a destination through objectives, or Success Spectrum stages, and connecting those to a financial value, we can begin to understand our problems and define them in a quantified way.

<br>

#### **Problem Landscapes: Defining problems and Understanding their Dimensions**

In the competitive landscape of digital customer acquisition, understanding the user journey is not just important—it's critical for the sustainability of the business model. A common approach is to envisage the user's interaction as a trajectory from initial landing to a predefined goal, usually linked to conversions or other business objectives. However, understanding this path is often left to qualitative assessments or generic analytics. 

*Add financial value metrics at each stage of the customer journey, referred to as the 'Success Spectrum,' to quantify and prioritize problems. Calculate the 'Pain Point Cost' which measures the financial impact of user friction or drop-offs at each stage. The sum of 'Value' and 'Pain Point Cost' provides the 'Total Potential of Stage.' The aggregation of these metrics equips us with a complete financial view of user interaction, thereby allowing for data-driven decision-making.*


| STAGE                    | VALUE   | PAIN POINT COST | TOTAL POTENTIAL OF STAGE | TOTAL VALUE OF STAGES | TOTAL POTENTIAL VALUE OF STAGES |
